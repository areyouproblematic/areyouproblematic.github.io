        Arguments about social justice are exhausting. Especially when you have them
        over and over again with people who constantly put the onus of proof on you.
        The easier it is to find sources to support your arguments, the more smoothly
        these conversations will go (relatively speaking) -- that's where we come in.
        We're here for the next time you need backup whenever your family members,
        coworkers, or neighbors post something problematic.

        New and better information is always welcome, and that's why our site will
        be constantly under construction. We'll make it a priority to update and add
        more content as our busy lives allow. Feel free to contact us at
        areyouproblematic@gmail.com about any missing information or comments you have
        for the team -- we'd love to hear from (some) of you.
