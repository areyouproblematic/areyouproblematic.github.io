    <div class="mission-statement">
      <p>
        Arguments about social justice are exhausting. Especially when you have them
        over and over again with people who constantly put the onus of proof on you.
        The easier it is to find sources to support your arguments, the more smoothly
        these conversations will go (relatively speaking) -- that's where we come in.
        We're here for the next time you need backup whenever your family members,
        coworkers, or neighbors post something problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
        New and better information is always welcome, and that's why our site will
        be constantly under construction. We'll make it a priority to update and add
        more content as our busy lives allow. Feel free to contact us at
        areyouproblematic@gmail.com about any missing information or comments you have
        for the team -- we'd love to hear from (some) of you.

      <h3>DACA</h3>

      <div class="myth-fact-set">
        <p class="myth">Myth: These immigrants are violent criminals.</p>
        <p>
          Fact: Any person accepted into DACA cannot have been convicted of a felony
          or significant misdemeanor.

      <div class="myth-fact-set">
        <p class="myth">Myth: They should become citizens the legal way like everyone else.</p>
        <p>
          Fact: “Current law does not grant any legal status for the class of
          individuals who are current recipients of DACA. Recipients of DACA are
          currently unlawfully present in the U.S. with their removal deferred.”
          DACA allows recipients who pay into the program ($500 a year) to work in
          the US legally without the fear of deportation. It does not at this point
          offer any path to citizenship. To gain full citizenship, an undocumented
          DACA recipient would either have to leave the US for several years and
          begin the immigration process from the start or marry a current US citizen.

      <div class="myth-fact-set">
        <p class="myth">Myth: DACA recipients don't pay taxes.</p>
        <p>
          Fact: The 1.3 million young undocumented immigrants enrolled or immediately
          eligible for DACA contribute an estimated $2 billion a year in state and
          local taxes. This includes personal income, property, and sales and excise taxes.

      <div class="myth-fact-set">
        <p class="myth">Myth: DACA recipients are going to college on taxpayer’s money.</p>
        <p>
          Fact: DACA students are not eligible for federal aid, although some states allow
          them to pay in-state tuition and colleges can provide scholarships.
